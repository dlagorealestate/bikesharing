## Overview

    The Purpose of this project was to help the investors see if bike rental is a good investment opportunity in Des Moines. Before we start we need key information to be able to get the information our investors would need to make an informed decision. Such as trips by the day, gender, trip duration, when they checkout the bikes and check them back in, and when is the best time to do maintenance on the bikes. 
    
## Results
    
   * There was a total of 2,344,224 trips in the month of August.

   * From the total trips 1,900,359 users subscribe to the company and 443,865 users are customers.

   * There is a peak number of users who rent their bike for 5-6 hour trips.

   * The largest number of individuals are male, the women users dont have as large of a peak and unkown users do not have a peak for tripduration.

   * The trips per weekday(by hour) are Thursday between 5pm-7pm is the most popular time to ride a bike.

   * The best time for Maintenance is 2-5 am where this is the time frame where the least amount of riders are.


## Summary


  * After getting all the data, it is clear this is a great investment opportunity for the investors. With 2.3 million trips in one month alone, it is a goldmine. Especially with a city like NYC where many people do not have vehicles, they can definitely capitlaize on this. Making Bikeshare an efficient and seemless way to rent a bike and park where they want will increase the likelihood of people using it.
